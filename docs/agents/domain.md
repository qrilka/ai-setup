# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`GLOSSARY.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`GLOSSARY-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists: it points at one `GLOSSARY.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `src/<context>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (most repos):

```text
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── docs/adr/
│   └── <decision-records>.md
└── src/
```

Multi-context repo (presence of `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` at the root):

```text
/
├── GLOSSARY-MAP.md
├── docs/adr/                          ← system-wide decisions
└── src/
    └── <context>/
        ├── GLOSSARY.md
        └── docs/adr/                  ← context-specific decisions
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept (in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name), use the term as defined in the glossary. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the needed concept isn't in the glossary yet, reconsider whether it reflects project language or note the gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
